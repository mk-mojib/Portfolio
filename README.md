**List the technologies, frameworks, and tools I used to build my e-commerce website.**

        - **ReactJS - Building Dynamic User Interfaces:**

        Dynamic UIs: ReactJS, a JavaScript library, is at the core of Moshop. It enables us to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces, ensuring a smooth and engaging shopping experience.

        Component-Based Architecture: Our frontend is built on a modular, component-based architecture, allowing for scalable and maintainable code.

        - **HTML & CSS - Crafting Elegant Web Pages:**

        Structural Integrity: HTML (HyperText Markup Language) forms the structural foundation of our web pages, ensuring proper document structure and semantics.

        Styling Excellence: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is employed for styling, making sure that each element is aesthetically pleasing and aligned with the Moshop brand.

        - **JavaScript - Enhancing Interactivity:**

        Client-Side Functionality: JavaScript enhances the interactivity of Moshop's website, enabling dynamic content updates, form validation, and a seamless user experience.

        AJAX for Asynchronous Requests: We utilize JavaScript's AJAX capabilities to make asynchronous requests, ensuring quick and efficient data retrieval.

        - **Git & GitHub - Version Control for Collaboration:**

        Version Control: Git provides a robust version control system, allowing our development team to collaborate seamlessly. It tracks changes, facilitates branching, and ensures a stable and organized codebase.

        Collaboration Platform: GitHub serves as our collaborative platform, enabling developers to contribute, review code, and manage project workflows efficiently.
